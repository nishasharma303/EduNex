# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# EduNex – AI-Assisted Student Collaboration Platform

## Overview

EduNex is an AI-assisted student collaboration platform designed to enhance peer-to-peer learning through guided artificial intelligence support. The platform enables students to post academic questions, answer peers, and receive AI-assisted verification while preserving human-driven learning and critical thinking.

Rather than acting as a direct answer-generation system, EduNex focuses on concept reinforcement, learning discipline, and meaningful academic engagement.

---

## Problem Statement

The widespread availability of AI tools has led to increased answer dependency among students, often reducing conceptual understanding and problem-solving ability. Traditional discussion forums also face challenges such as inconsistent answer quality, lack of validation, and low student engagement.

EduNex addresses these issues by integrating controlled AI assistance with collaborative learning and focus-oriented study mechanisms.

---

## Objectives

- Promote peer-to-peer academic collaboration  
- Encourage active learning over passive answer consumption  
- Provide AI-assisted verification to reduce misinformation  
- Support conceptual understanding through hints and visual learning  
- Improve study discipline using distraction-aware study sessions  

---

## Features

### Peer Question and Answer System
Students can post academic questions and respond to peers, enabling collaborative learning and discussion.

### AI-Verified Responses
Submitted answers are evaluated by AI for conceptual correctness and relevance, helping maintain content quality.

### AI-Generated Learning Hints
Instead of providing complete solutions, the system generates hints and guidance to encourage independent problem-solving.

### Concept Mind-Map Generation
AI-generated mind maps visually represent topics and sub-concepts, supporting better understanding and knowledge retention.

### Distraction-Tracking Study Sessions
The platform includes focused study sessions that monitor user activity to encourage sustained attention during learning periods.

### Gamified Leaderboards
Student engagement is supported through leaderboards based on participation, answer quality, and focused study behavior.
